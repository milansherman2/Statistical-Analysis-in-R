Exploring predictive metrics in  baseball

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Using data to increase a sports team’s odds of winning has become standard in professional sports over the last 20 years. In the early 2000s, the Oakland A’s were early adopters, or even inventors of this approach to assembling a competitive baseball team as chronicled in the book (and movie) Moneyball (2011). While the strategy is not new, I am interested in identifying baseball metrics that are predictive of winning. Given the amount of money that is generated by professional sports, the ability to gain a competitive edge via data is crucial. In the current context, the ubiquity of leveraging data in sports has perhaps changes this approach from one of opportunity to a necessity in order to not lose ground on competitors </p>
  
  <h2>Research Questions</h2>
<p>My research question evolved and came into focus as I became more familiar with my datasets. I found that the datasets that I’d chosen were best suited to generating offensive metrics, and that offensive metrics are generally related more to runs scored than winning or losing in the research that I’d done. I did not want to lose sight of winning or losing, but decided to first relate my metrics to runs scored as it makes sense that these metrics would be much more predictive of runs scored.</p>

In the end, I focused in the following research question:
- What batting metrics are most highly correlated with runs scored? Which metrics are most predictive of winning or losing?

<h2>Data</h2>  

Below are the datasets that I used for this analysis:
